In the pursuit to expand my skills and knowledge in Azure, I embarked on the [Azure Cloud Resume Challenge](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/docs/the-challenge/azure/). I first discovered this challenge through Gwyn's [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYrBWmkfno&t=3297s) and I knew right away it'd be a fun project with tremendous learning opportunities. Despite having zero experience with Terraform and having only basic knowledge of GitHub Actions and Azure I was optimistic about using my programming and process automation skills to take an infrastructure as code approach to this challenge.
