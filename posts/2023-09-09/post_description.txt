This project was created  to discover high volume options contracts within the first thirty minutes of market open. It scrapes data from the [Chicago Board Options Exchange](https://www.cboe.com/us/options/market_statistics/symbol_data/?mkt=cone){target="_blank"} (CBOE) to find potential profitable options based on some basic filters. This is a rudimentary scanner that only identifies weekly options.
