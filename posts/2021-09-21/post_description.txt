I discovered this fantastic [post](https://blog.getdbt.com/modeling-subscription-revenue/){target="_blank"} written by Claire Carroll and I was instantly inspired. I really enjoyed studying her process and figured that it'd be a fun exercise to implement this data transformation in R. I'm not going to convert the SQL code from Claire's post to R code verbatim. Instead, I'll implement my own process for the data transformation. Overall, the input and output data will be the same as in Claire's post.
