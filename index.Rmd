Hi there `r emo::ji("wave")`, I'm Laurence and welcome to my blog. I made this webiste to show people what I'm interested in, to highlight the beauty of the R programming language from my perspective and also as a medium for myself and others to learn.  

I graduated from the University of Florida in the summer of 2017 with a B.S. in Statistics and since then I have had the pleasure of working with a wide variety of data from political, health and criminal intelligence domains. Currently I work at the University of Florida Clinical and Translational Science Institute as a Data Management Analyst where I spend my days cleaning, transforming, visualizing and analyzing clinical research data in R. 

When I'm not working with R I enjoy reading books, especially statistics books like Naked Statistics, surfing the web for data science stuff, watching television, going to parks and biking.
